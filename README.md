# Home Equity Loan Classification

This is the repository for the final team project in the course CIS 432 - Predictive Analytics in Python at Simon Business School. In this assignment, my team and I built a predictive model decision support system that evaluates the risk of Home Equity Line of Credit applications (HELOC).

Our final choice for this project was a logistic regression classifier with an accuracy of 0.716 and True Positive Rate of 78.18. We chose TPR as our choice of metric in this case, the true positive rate is significant as it helps banks or credit companies identify whether their prediction model for loan default is capable of predicting whether consumers are likely to pay their loan. Having a high positive rate indicates that the model is effective in identifying individuals who are likely to default on a loan. If the TPR is higher, it means that the model is correctly able to capture a higher proportion of bad risk customers, which is very important in the case of credit risk.
